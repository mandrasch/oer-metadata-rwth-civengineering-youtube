Experiment: Store schema.org/LRMI metadata in git repo?
(Its easier for some projects as alternative to implement schema.org in their webpage and/or for youtube videos, because CC BY 3.0 US is the only free license YouTube supports currently)

Idea: Project staff just shares metadate in git repository as LD-JSON, will be crawled by search engines/other services 

Experiment in context of #TOSIoer (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14jMeONt1-uW9QKOuciZBw9uGSR6GC6JHzfBx9uckp3g/edit#slide=id.p)
