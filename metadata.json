    "description": "Flood polders are used to improve water retention and thus attenuate flood peaks in the course of small-scale and average flood events. Breach formation processes and its influencing factors are still subject to a number of uncertainties. In that context, physical model tests of dike breaches were performed in the hydraulic laboratory in Aachen to quantify the targeted filling of flood polders.",
